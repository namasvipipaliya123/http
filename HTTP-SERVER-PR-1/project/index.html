    <p id="grid">To handle asynchronous code, Node uses a callback-based system. Node functions and methods that will
        implement some asynchronous activity take a callback function. This callback will be called whenever the
        asynchronous operation has resolved. By convention, the first argument of this callback is an error placeholder.
        If an error occurred in the asynchronous operation occurred (trying to read a non-existent file, for example),
        the error argument will be an Error object, but it will be null if no error occurs.</p>
